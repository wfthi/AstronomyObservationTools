# AstronomyObservationTools

Tools to help planning night observations. The code is heavily based on astropy routines.

The first plot shows the contribution of the Moon to the sky backgound brightness as function of the Sun-Moon and Moon-target separations

The plot below shows an estimate of the sky brightness above Cerro Paranal in a clear sky. The Sun and the Moon azimuths are shown (the altitude is set to zero when the actual value is below the horizon). The simple scattering model of Krisciunas & Schaefer is used to model the Moon scattered-light contribution to the sky brightness.
